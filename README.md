# wood-dynamic-properties-LCF
Data includes dynamic mechanical properties of spruce wood and load-deflection in low-cycle fatigue. This data has been used in research article for prediction of fatigue life of spruce wood in bending fatigue loading.

Data of dynamic mechanical properties is in a file named FDD009 and data of load-deflection is in files named SF009_x. 
Dynamic mechanical properties data column names (FDD009):
1. natural frequency [Hz]
2. density [kg/m^3]
3. damping []
4. modulus of elasticity [GPa]
5. weight [g]
6. heigth [mm]
7. breadth [mm]
8. length [mm]
Load-deflection data rows (SF009_x):
1. force [N]
2. deflection [mm]

Load-deflection data extraction is given in python code.
